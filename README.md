A quick little project that I did during my internship. It takes in a JSON object from a SSH query and pulls relevant information into a database. It also uses the REST API to pull information from JIRA to the database as well.

Plans:
	Import data to SLIM. 
	Maybe a UI through Django or Flask (need to research).
