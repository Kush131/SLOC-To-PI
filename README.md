A quick little project that I did during my internship. It takes in a JSON object from a SSH query and pulls relevant information into a database. It also uses the REST API to pull information from JIRA to the database as well.

Runthrough: 

The first files created were the json_parse_to_SQL.py and json_parse_to_xlsx.py files as a prototype to display functionality. 

new_sql_parse.py was the final version, but was still very prototipical. 

Note: I am fully aware there are probably more efficient ways of doing multiple things in the code. I used this project to learn how to use Python and also was working on an approaching deadline.
